Mage in the middle is a messaging platform intended for table-top games, like Dungeons and Dragons. It features the ability to create cryptic messages for players to interact with. These messages will be written in in-game languages available for everyone to see but only those characters with the languages to understand. Future features may include encrypted messages to keep languages group-based, chatbots for NPCs, and message types (vocal, carved, signs, letters, etc...).

The stack utilized will be vue.js, java, postgres SQL.
